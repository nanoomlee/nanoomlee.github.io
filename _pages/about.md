Hi, I'm Nanoom. I'm a Horizon postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University working with [Prof. Marc Kamionkowski](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/kamionkowski/) since Oct 2024. I did my PhD in 2024 at New York University where I worked with two amazing scholars, [Prof. Yacine Ali-Ha&#xef;moud](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/yacine/) and [Prof. Roman Scoccimarro](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/roman/).

I got my M.A in physics at Stony Brook in 2018 where I worked with [Prof. Marilena LoVerde](https://phys.washington.edu/people/marilena-loverde). During this time I had been supported by the Korean Government Scholarship for Overseas Study.
My B.S in physics and mathematics is from Korea University in 2016 with First Rank Graduation Award.

I'm broadly interested in theoretical cosmology including CMB, recombination, large-scale structure of the universe, redshift-space distortion, DM-baryon scattering, 21cm.

If you have any questions or want to discuss something, feel free to contact me via email!
