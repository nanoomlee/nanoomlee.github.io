  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*â€ , A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

    title = "{Boosting galaxy clustering analyses with non-perturbative modelling of redshift-space distortions}",
    abstract = {Redshift-space distortions (RSD), caused by the peculiar velocities of galaxies, are a key modelling challenge in galaxy clustering analyses, limiting the scales from which cosmological information can be reliably extracted.  Unlike dynamical or galaxy bias effects, RSD imprint features that are sensitive to non-linearities across all scales.  Yet, no distinction between these effects is made by the state-of-the-art analytical approach---the effective field theory (EFT)---which applies the same perturbative expansion to each of them.  This paper explores an alternative approach, where the non-perturbative nature of RSD is partially preserved, and compares its effectiveness against the EFT in analysing power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles from synthetic samples of luminous red galaxies, using the projected sensitivity of a Stage-IV galaxy survey.  Our results demonstrate that this distinct treatment of RSD improves the robustness of model predictions for both statistics, extending the validity range of the EFT from approximately $0.2\,\hinvMpc$ to $0.35\,\hinvMpc$ for the one-loop power spectrum and from $0.1\,\hinvMpc$ to $0.14\,\hinvMpc$ for the tree-level bispectrum.  This leads to a significant enhancement in the precision of cosmological parameter constraints, with uncertainties on the Hubble rate, matter density, and scalar amplitude of fluctuations reduced by $20$-$40\,\%$ for the power spectrum multipoles alone compared to the EFT, and by $25$-$50\,\%$ for joint analyses with the bispectrum.  The RSD treatment proposed here may thus play a crucial role in maximising the scientific return of current and future galaxy surveys.  To support this advancement, all models for the power spectrum and bispectrum used in this work are made available through an extended version of the Python package \texttt{COMET}.}

    title = "{Magnetic fields from small-scale primordial perturbations}",
	abstract = {Weak magnetic fields must have existed in the early Universe, as they were sourced by the cross product of electron density and temperature gradients through the Biermann-battery mechanism. In this paper we calculate the magnetic fields generated at cosmic dawn by a variety of small-scale primordial perturbations, carefully computing the evolution of electron density and temperature fluctuations, and consistently accounting for relative velocities between baryons and dark matter. We first compute the magnetic field resulting from standard, nearly scale-invariant primordial adiabatic perturbations, making significant improvements to previous calculations. This ``standard" primordial field has a root mean square (rms) of a few times $10^{-15}$ nG at $20\lesssim z \lesssim 100$, with fluctuations on $\sim$ kpc comoving scales, and could serve as the seed of present-day magnetic fields observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. In addition, we consider early-Universe magnetic fields as a possible probe of non-standard initial conditions of the Universe on small scales $k \sim 1\text{--}10^3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To this end, we compute the maximally-allowed magnetic fields within current upper limits on small-scale adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations. Enhanced small-scale adiabatic fluctuations below current Cosmic Microwave Background spectral-distortion constraints could produce magnetic fields as large as $\sim 5\times 10^{-11}$ nG at $z = 20$. Uncorrelated small-scale isocurvature perturbations within current Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis bounds could potentially enhance the rms magnetic field to $\sim 10^{-14}\text{--}10^{-10}$ nG at $z = 20$, depending on the specific isocurvature mode considered. While these very weak fields remain well below current observational capabilities, our work points out that magnetic fields could potentially provide an interesting window into the poorly constrained small-scale initial conditions of the Universe.},
